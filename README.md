# Overly Specific CSS Selectors

This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle CSS bug: overly specific selectors that unintentionally limit style application. This can lead to inconsistent styling and unexpected visual outcomes.

The `bug.css` file contains the problematic code. The `bugSolution.css` file shows how to correct this issue by using more general selectors or improving the CSS structure.  The README explains the root cause and solution.

## Root Cause

Overly specific CSS selectors, often created by chaining multiple class or ID selectors, limit the elements the style is applied to.  If the HTML structure or class names change, the styles might unexpectedly disappear or not apply correctly. 

## Solution

The best solution depends on the specifics, but often involve:

1. **Simplifying Selectors:** Reduce the number of selectors chained together.
2. **Using More General Selectors:** Employ broader selectors like class or element selectors instead of overly specific ones.
3. **Improved CSS Structure:** Organize CSS into reusable classes and utilize inheritance or mixins to avoid repetitive specific selectors.
4. **CSS Preprocessors (like Sass or Less):** Preprocessors can help to improve CSS structure and maintainability thereby avoiding issues from overly specific selectors.
